In school we gave each other little papers where some messages have been on. Someone always intercepted the "chat" and read the messages. I then invented a kind of "encryption" we use. The problem I was facing then was, that it took way to long to write a message and to understand it. So I came up with a new unique idea. It worked great! It was easy to write and easy to read. This is just a program which is abe to encrypt and decrypt messages back using that "algorithm". Just for fun :D
