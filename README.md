In school we gave each other little papers where some messages have been on. Someone always intercepted the "chat" and read the message. I then invented a kind of "encryption" we use. The problem I was facing then was, that it took way to long to write a message and to understand it. So I came up with the idea to just put bullhist in the message and just read the letters in intervals. It worked great! It was easy to write and easy to read. This is just a program which is abe to encrypt and decrypt messages back using that "algorithm". Just for fun :D
